# Data collection

The event log consists of 1696 cases between January 2015 and August 2017. Although, majority of the cases happened in 2017. Each procurement contains the following attributes

- <b>Comment</b>: If the process was a reversal of an existing process
- <b>Gross Amount</b>: The gross amount for each case
